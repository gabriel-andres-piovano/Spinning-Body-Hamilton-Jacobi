[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/868511316.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14281746)

Collection of Mathematica notebooks and packages to solve the linearized Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, and compute the small spin corrections to the asymptotic GW fluxes.
If you make use of these codes in part or in full, please acknoledge "Piovano, Pantelidou, Mac Uilliam and Witzany" arXiv:2410.05769 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05769v1)

Some notebooks also request additional citations (see the description of TeukolskySpinFluxesHamiltonJacobi.wl")
